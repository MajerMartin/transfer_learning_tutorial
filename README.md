# Transfer Learning Tutorial

This transfer learning tutorial was created for PwC Czech Republic knowledge sharing. First section focuses on the intuition behind transfer learning, second part is devoted to two practical examples:
* image classification
* image indexing and retrieval

Both examples use small subset of [DeepFashion](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion.html) dataset.
